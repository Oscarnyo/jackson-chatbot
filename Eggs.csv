Chicken,21,99.5,58,18,98.5,66 -75,"Here are some good practices for chicken egg incubation: 

1. Choose healthy eggs that are clean, uncracked, and free from abnormalities. 
2. Set up the incubator correctly by following the manufacturer's instructions for setting the temperature and humidity levels.
3. Maintain a temperature between 99?F and 100.5?F (37.2?C to 38.1?C).
4. Maintain a humidity level of around 50% for the first 18 days and increase to 65-75% for the last 3 days of incubation. 
5. Turn the eggs regularly to prevent the embryo from sticking to the shell and stop turning the eggs 3 days before they are due to hatch.
6. Candling can be done after 7-10 days of incubation to check for fertility.
7. Do not help the chicks out of their shells as they need to do it on their own to develop properly.

By following these practices, you can increase the chances of a successful hatch."
